# Android_amaharic_Health_tip
This app provides prevention for common well known deadliest illnesses.  When people think of the deadliest diseases in the world, their minds probably jump to the fast-acting, incurable ones that grab headlines from time to time. But in fact, many of these types of diseases donâ€™t rank in the top 10 causes of worldwide deaths.  Perhaps even more surprising is that several of the deadliest diseases are partially preventable. Non-preventable factors include where a person lives, access to preventive care, and quality of healthcare. Regarding this, this application provides prevention techniques and valuabile information in Amaharic.
